# Plain Spring Boot App on Kubernetes with the istio service mesh

This projects deploys two microservices in kubernetes and interconnects these with the istio [service mesh](https://istio.io)


# Installation on minikube

Follow these links to install istio in a new minikube cluster. Once you follow these steps you have a setup with automatic sidecar injection.
The infrastructure of istio is automatically injected into the pod. So you don't need to extend your configuration to benefit from istio.

# Enable automatic sidecar injection

After following the installation steps istio is deployed and can automatically inject the sidecars into the pod.
This needs to be enabled by setting the istio-injection=enabled - Label to the needed namespace.

```
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
```

# Deploy the app

```
helm upgrade test . -i -w
```

# Access the app

The ingress controller will expose the service at http://frontend.minikube.local .

Check the status of the istio mesh.  You should see your pods in the overview:

```
istioctl proxy-status
```

Sample output:

````
